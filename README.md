## Weather Database

### The main goal of Weather Database was to extract city data into a JSON file and transform it into presentable data. Being able to parse through the data, we were able to get important information for each city such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and a description. From there, we were able to extract the [data](https://github.com/Ctblossey/WeatherPy/blob/main/Weather_Database/WeatherPY_Database.csv) into a csv file.

## Vacation Search

### With the Vacation Search exercise, we were able to create an interactive map. This map was created by taking user inputs for preferred temperatures and adding hotel information onto the previously exported data. Instead of looking through data, the user is able to click on a location on the map and see key metrics for the selected hotel.

## Vacation Itinerary

### The Vacation Itinerary is for the user once they arrive at their destination. One goal of traveling is to visit additional cities. With the interactive map created in this exercise, the user is able to view a recommended driving route to nearby cities.
